# 8. Annotate SNP List

Next thing we want to do is to look for candidate genes within the QTL region in Nipponbare, go to "**Search**"-\> "**Gene Loci**".

Set "**Japonica nipponbare**" as reference genome.

Set "**SNP Annotator (My SNP List)**" in Search.

Set "**All**" to search all Gene models available.

Tick the box to "**Include gene interactions (RiceNetv2, PRIN)**" and "**Gene Ontology**" annotations. You may choose to add more to gather more annotations for this region.

The result should be a table which contains the annotations that can be grouped by marker position, gene locus, or by QTL.
